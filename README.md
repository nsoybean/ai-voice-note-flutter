# AI Voice Note

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This is my personal attempt at building a macOS app using Flutter, focused on AI-powered voice notes.

## What is this?

A fun side project to learn Flutter for desktop and experiment with AI features for voice note-taking.  
Think of it as a smart, simple, and modern way to capture your thoughts on your Mac.

## Why?

- To explore Flutter's capabilities on macOS
- To play with AI and voice recognition
- Because building cool stuff is fun!
